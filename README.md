# Runaway-Planet-Scripts-Only
Prototype of a serious game for a client inside the EPA. The game is intended to be used in educational environments to highlight the intricacies and difficulties of environmental policy and also provide a message about the seriousness of global warming. Note that this is only the set of scripts which handle state in the game, as the world map itself is based on a licensed asset.
